# ViewSQLPlugin

This plugin adds a new context menu entry to the "File" dropdown in MSTR dossiers labeled "View SQL".

When "View SQL" is clicked, a pop-up appears and displays the SQL for all the datasets in that dossier.

The compiled and non-compiled code is checked in so that you can both see the source code and simply drop this plugin into your web server.
